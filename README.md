# Operating Systems

This repository contains lab assignments and code related to an operating systems course.

## Labs

### Lab 1: Introduction to C and Linux Shell
This lab covers the basics of C programming and shell scripting.

*   `hello.c`: A simple "Hello, World!" program in C.
*   `shell.sh`: A basic shell script.

### Lab 2: CPU Scheduling Algorithms
This lab implements several common CPU scheduling algorithms.

*   `scheduling.cpp`: An implementation of First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), and Round Robin (RR) scheduling algorithms.

### Lab 3: Process Management
This lab explores process creation and management in a Unix-like environment.

*   `fork.c`: Demonstrates the use of the `fork()` system call to create a new process.
*   `exec.c`: Shows how to use the `exec()` family of system calls to replace the current process image.
*   `process.c`: Combines `fork()` and `exec()` to create and run new processes.

## Other Materials

This section includes other code and materials related to operating systems concepts.

*   `register.c`: A C program that demonstrates the use of the `register` keyword and measures execution time.
*   `why-memory-size-is-power-of-2.md`: An explanation of why memory sizes are typically powers of 2.
